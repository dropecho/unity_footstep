## Quickstart

Look at usage below.

## Install
To use this, install it through the package manager.

You can click on the code button in the top right, copy that or just copy this 
```git@github.com:dropecho/unity_utils.git```

Open unity, and open the package manager, in the dropdown select install from git, and paste that in.

## Usage

This is mostly a compilation of random script utilities, so just looking through the code is best, but here is an example of using the
Generic Scriptable Object Editor window.
